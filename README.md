## REST API (Representational State Transfer)

Representational State Transfer is a software architectural style that defines a set of 
constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST 
architectural style, termed RESTful Web services, provide interoperability between 
computer systems on the Internet. 

REST or RESTful API design (Representational State Transfer) is designed to take advantage 
of existing protocols. While REST can be used over nearly any protocol, it usually takes 
advantage of HTTP when used for Web APIs.
